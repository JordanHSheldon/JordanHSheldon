## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jordan and I am a Software engineer working for BorgWarner doing just about anything but mostly web development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about each piece of web development more in depth. Some examples are:
  - Databases
  - EventStores
  - MessageQueues
  - Web servers

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - Web projects
  - tools
  - Anything that will help me learn about web development.
